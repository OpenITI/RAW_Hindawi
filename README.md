# RAW_Hindawi

This repository contains unconverted epub files from the [Hindawi library](https://www.hindawi.org/).

In 2019, a first scrape of the Hindawi website was carried out, including only the metadata, not the texts themselves.
In May 2023, a second scrape was carried out, in which the text files (and metadata) from the following categories only were scraped: 

```
literature
religions
history
geography
novels
biographies
poetry
linguistics
philosophy
arts
plays
``` 

Not scraped were:

```
business
economics
technology
politics
health
psychology
science
```
